# Aquaponics-
Aquaponics is a sustainable system combining aquaculture and hydroponics in a closed loop. Fish waste nourishes plants, and plants purify water for fish. Using sensors and microcontrollers, it automates monitoring of pH, temperature, and water level, promoting eco-friendly, efficient, and smart farming practices.
