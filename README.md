🌱 Smart Aquaponics System

A Sustainable, Automated, and Intelligent Food Production Model

📌 Overview

Aquaponics is a sustainable food production system that combines aquaculture (fish farming) and hydroponics (soilless plant cultivation) in a single closed-loop ecosystem. Fish produce natural nutrients that feed the plants, while the plants filter and purify the water, creating a balanced, eco-friendly cycle.

This project enhances traditional aquaponics using sensors, microcontrollers, and automation to enable real-time monitoring and control of critical system parameters, making farming smarter, cleaner, and more efficient.

🌿 Key Features

✔️ Closed-loop aquaponics ecosystem
✔️ Automated monitoring of pH, temperature, and water level
✔️ Real-time data visualization
✔️ Minimal water usage and zero chemical fertilizer requirement
✔️ Scalable and energy-efficient design
✔️ Ideal for urban farming and smart agriculture applications

Upload the provided firmware code to the microcontroller and connect the sensors as described in the documentation.

▶️ How It Works
-Fish produce ammonia-based waste.
-Beneficial bacteria convert ammonia into nitrates.
-Plants absorb nitrates as nutrients.
-Plants naturally purify the water and return it back to the fish tank.
-Sensors continuously measure system conditions
-The microcontroller automates aeration, pumping, and alerts based on thresholds.
